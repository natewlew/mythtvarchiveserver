# MythTVArchiveServer

MythTV Archive Server is a simple way to create small, commercial free files from MythTV recordings. You can archive recordings from the MythTV interface as a userjob or from the Archive Server's web interface. It uses HandBrake to transcode the recordings into much smaller files.

Ideally the archive server runs on a different computer than the MythTV backend server. This frees up resources to transcode the recordings.
